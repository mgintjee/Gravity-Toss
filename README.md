# Gravity-Toss
My take on the original pong game that utilizes gravity and user customization of the game mechanics.

Users can choose the colors of the game objects, as well as the game mechanics. Less gravity, more gravity, faster paddles, stronger paddle reflect. All these are completely modifiable by the user.

Made this game as a means to understand and better my knowledge of Unity.
